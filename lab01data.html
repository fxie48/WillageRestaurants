    <font size = "4"> Did you know that an average American adult eats more than double the amount of sodium that is recommended? This is about 3,400 miligrams of sodium, 1,900 milligrams more than <a href="https://www.heart.org/-/media/data-import/downloadables/8/2/0/pe-abh-why-should-i-limit-sodium-ucm_300625.pdf">American Heart Association's</a>‹› recommended daily allowance. But why does this matter? What's so special about sodium? You may have been told that you should reduce your sodium intake by your doctor during your last checkup. </font>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font size = "4"> With extra sodium in your bloodstream, it pulls water into your blood vessels, increasing the volume of blood inside your blood vessels, increasing blood pressure, and possibly leading to hypertension. High blood pressure increases the risks of heart disease or even having a stroke. Because of this, a big step towards living a healthier and longer life is first by knowing what exactly you are consuming when you eat different types of food. Here, a simple infographic is provided to you for rough sodium estimates in popular fast foods that can be found at any fast food restaurant or dining hall. </font>
     <br>
     <br>
     <font size = "4"> As shown, 2 oz servings of cold cut meats, a slize of pizza with several toppings, and one cup of canned soup may all each contain half of your daily recommended dietary sodium. This goes for chicken, burritos, and tacos as well. Similarily, although bread and rolls may not seem to contain much sodium, the amount average adults eat per day may add up to a significant amount of sodium. </font>
     <br>
     <br>
     <font size = "4"> However, consuming such a significant amount of sodium every day can be avoided! The sodium in most foods simply depends on how you prepare them. By trying to limit the amount of sodium you use to marinate your chicken or make your burritos can greatly reduce your amount of sodium intake.</font>
